1. Create ssh keys on Client
install ssh: brew install openssh
start ssh agent: eval $(ssh-agent)
genrate ssh key: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096 -C "{username@emaildomain.com}" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
(you can find username on the Account Setting page, it is not the logged email on Bitbucket)

2. Add the new created key on client
add key: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

3. Go to Bitbucket, add the public key
check key works: ssh -T git@bitbucket.org
